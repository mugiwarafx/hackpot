# Change Log

#### All notable changes to the "Hackpot" extension will be documented in this file

### Apr 5 2020
* Changed the names of the nature themes for the last time
  * Hackpot is more of a list of themes now, not really the name of my nature theme like from when I started this
* Darkened the background of Garden Of Atlantis a lil, much better color clarity
* Fixed a scope change that I missed when coverting to the improved highlighting syntax

### Apr 4 2020
* Darkened the new tan color for the nature themes 5%
  * think it looks better as a tan, not so peachy

### Apr 3 2020
* Added new theme Hackpot Batman vs Joker
  * Vision came from the old comic books, but I combined some of the new colors as well
  * Has improved syntax highlighting
* Updated the other themes to have the same scopes for highlighting, not the colors
  * Added tan to the nature themes since I needed one more color to match Batman vs Joker
* Fixed some of the stuff on the info page
* Also added a new icon for these themes
  * Modified the credits portion of the info page

### Apr 1 2020
* Added some more support for Dart
  * Some key options aren't yet supported for Dart syntax highlighting
  * I'll keep an eye out for other features that pop up
  * Recommend using Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 while programming in Dart
    * Currently there's no syntax highlighting available for brackets otherwise
* Added more bash support

### Mar 29 2020
* Made a few minor changes on the info page
* Changed the name to all the theme files to gain some benefits while coding in vscode
* Changed the name to Mint Chocolate to be Mudslide
  * More of a naturistic name
  * Since I renamed all the theme files I figured now is a good time lol

### Mar 26 2020
* Adjusted the background for Mudslide, Purple Haze, and Poisoned
  * Was a lil hard on the eyes and in my opinion they look much better lol

### Mar 24 2020
* Added new theme option Hackpot Under The Sea
  * Same syntax highlighting with a teal background
  * If you like Solarized, you'll love this one
* Added new theme option Hackpot Mudslide
  * Same syntax highlighting with a brown background
* Added new theme option Hackpot Purple Haze
  * In memory of Jimi Hendrix
  * Same syntax highlighting with a purple background
* Added new theme option Hackpot Poisoned
  * Same syntax highlighting with a green background
* Not sure why everytime I add a new color theme option vscode kicks you out of my theme and reverts back to the default theme
  * Sorry if that drove you nuts with me adding these themes and having to reselect your theme, it annoyed the hell out of me lol

### Mar 23 2020
* Fixed a few small things on Hackpot Dark
* I'm also thinking of a new theme idea I'll add as a 3rd option to this theme, just configuring the colors for it
* I decided to name standard Hackpot to Hackpot Soft, meaning softer on the eyes

### Mar 19 2020
* A request for a darker background option was made, so I made it :)
  * I still have the standard option
  * To choose darker option, go to change color theme to Hackpot Dark
* Brightened the find highlight color
  * Was a bit hard to see the highlight of nonselected items in search

### Mar 15 2020
* Fixed a typo on the info page lol

### Mar 9 2020
* Minor eye friendly changes
* Small change on theme description

### Mar 3 2020
* Adjusted hot pink and red orange to make them a lil easier on the eyes

### Feb 25 2020
* Lightened the text, variable, and sidebar foreground color 5%
  * Surprised me by making things easier to read
* Darkened breadcrumbs color 10%
  * Made it less distracting

### Feb 18 2020
* Made parameters a little darker just to separate them from variables

### Feb 13 2020
* Added support for new feature folded code highlighting
* Minor info improvements

### Feb 11 2020
* Changed variable language this and self to light red instead of purple
  * Thought it would be better to separate booleons and these keywords
  * Also thought adding red would be a nice touch since red is a common flower color

### Feb 10 2020
* Added color red orange for support.type.exception
  * Figured if you're going to toy with how errors are handled, it'd be best to spot them out easily
* Brightened the scrollbar to make easier to see 

### Feb 6 2020
* Modified colors in settings page to fit the theme better
* Added color behavior descriptions on README

### Feb 4 2020
* Added some more functionality for JavaScript
  * Mostly keyword.operators that perform function like actions with punctuations to help them stand out better
  * Added more support for regex

### Feb 1 2020
* Slightly lightened the background colors for readability
* Added more functionality for Python

### Jan 28 2020
* Changed keyword.operator.expression color

### Jan 23 2020
* Added a different color for storage type
  * Was hard to tell which was a storage type or a function in languages like Go or C without reading through the code
* Switched the colors yellow and purple
  * Seems to help pop out the key items better since yellow and orange are fairly similar
  * Certain file types barely used purple, and since I like purple better than yellow, I switched them lol
* Think I'm done switching around colors
  * If I add more color functionality, it'll be from new features I haven't played with yet that has no color highlighting
  * I will still look for other languages to add more support

### Jan 13 2020
* Added foreground color to the file you're in on the explorer to make it easier to see which file you're in
* Added the theme colors to the terminal colors

### Jan 11 2020
* Changed line numbers color to comments color (felt there was no reason for the line numbers to stand out)

### Jan 09 2020
* Removed the color tan
  * Many said it looked too yellowish on their screens (my screen looked tan, but I saw what they saw)
  * Also Python variables wouldn't use the color on variables
  * Go would only use it when you initualize the variable
  * I tried to find another tan to replace it but they either didn't look tan or they conflicted with the brown or orange so I thought it'd be best to just remove it all together
  * Had some confusion with how they were colored
* Made meta objects light green instead of purple to prevent confusion with built in constants
* Fixed theme on notifications
* Modified info page

### Jan 07 2020
* Made attribute name in html brown instead of green to separate the colors better
* Made lists in markdown green instead of yellow
* Made table separators yellow instead of green
* Added color to string literals in JS

### Jan 02 2020
* Fixed credit link for icon
* Modified preview
* Started using changelog for updates

### Jan 01 2020
