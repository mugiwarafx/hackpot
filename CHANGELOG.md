# Change Log

#### All notable changes to the "Hackpot" extension will be documented in this file.

### Jan 23 2020
* Added a little more functionality to a few languages to match others
* Switched the colors yellow and purple
  * Seems to help pop out the key items better since yellow and orange are fairly similar
  * Certain file types barely used purple, and since I like purple better than yellow, I switched them lol
* Think I'm done switching around colors
  * If I add more color functionality, it'll be from new features I haven't played with yet that has no color highlighting
  * I will still look for other languages to add more support

### Jan 13 2020
* Added foreground color to the file you're in on the explorer to make it easier to see which file you're in
* Added the theme colors to the terminal colors

### Jan 11 2020
* Changed line numbers color to comments color (felt there was no reason for the line numbers to stand out)

### Jan 09 2020
* Removed the color tan
  * Many said it looked too yellowish on their screens (my screen looked tan, but I saw what they saw)
  * Also Python variables wouldn't use the color on variables
  * Go would only use it when you initualize the variable
  * I tried to find another tan to replace it but they either didn't look tan or they conflicted with the brown or orange so I thought it'd be best to just remove it all together
  * Had some confusion with how they were colored
* Made meta objects light green instead of purple to prevent confusion with built in constants
* Fixed theme on notifications
* Modified info page

### Jan 07 2020
* Made attribute name in html brown instead of green to separate the colors better
* Made lists in markdown green instead of yellow
* Made table separators yellow instead of green
* Added color to string literals in JS
