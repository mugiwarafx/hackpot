# Change Log

#### All notable changes to the "Hackpot" extension will be documented in this file.

### Mar 15 2020
* Fixed a typo on the info page lol

### Mar 9 2020
* Minor eye friendly changes
* Small change on theme description

### Mar 3 2020
* Adjusted hot pink and red orange to make them a lil easier on the eyes

### Feb 25 2020
* Lightened the text, variable, and sidebar foreground color 5%
  * Surprised me by making things easier to read
* Darkened breadcrumbs color 10%
  * Made it less distracting

### Feb 18 2020
* Made parameters a little darker just to separate them from variables

### Feb 13 2020
* Added support for new feature folded code highlighting
* Minor info improvements

### Feb 11 2020
* Changed variable language this and self to light red instead of purple
  * Thought it would be better to separate booleons and these keywords
  * Also thought adding red would be a nice touch since red is a common flower color

### Feb 10 2020
* Added color red orange for support.type.exception
  * Figured if you're going to toy with how errors are handled, it'd be best to spot them out easily
* Brightened the scrollbar to make easier to see 

### Feb 6 2020
* Modified colors in settings page to fit the theme better
* Added color behavior descriptions on README

### Feb 4 2020
* Added some more functionality for JavaScript
  * Mostly keyword.operators that perform function like actions with punctuations to help them stand out better
  * Added more support for regex

### Feb 1 2020
* Slightly lightened the background colors for readability
* Added more functionality for Python

### Jan 28 2020
* Changed keyword.operator.expression color

### Jan 23 2020
* Added a different color for storage type
  * Was hard to tell which was a storage type or a function in languages like Go or C without reading through the code
* Switched the colors yellow and purple
  * Seems to help pop out the key items better since yellow and orange are fairly similar
  * Certain file types barely used purple, and since I like purple better than yellow, I switched them lol
* Think I'm done switching around colors
  * If I add more color functionality, it'll be from new features I haven't played with yet that has no color highlighting
  * I will still look for other languages to add more support

### Jan 13 2020
* Added foreground color to the file you're in on the explorer to make it easier to see which file you're in
* Added the theme colors to the terminal colors

### Jan 11 2020
* Changed line numbers color to comments color (felt there was no reason for the line numbers to stand out)

### Jan 09 2020
* Removed the color tan
  * Many said it looked too yellowish on their screens (my screen looked tan, but I saw what they saw)
  * Also Python variables wouldn't use the color on variables
  * Go would only use it when you initualize the variable
  * I tried to find another tan to replace it but they either didn't look tan or they conflicted with the brown or orange so I thought it'd be best to just remove it all together
  * Had some confusion with how they were colored
* Made meta objects light green instead of purple to prevent confusion with built in constants
* Fixed theme on notifications
* Modified info page

### Jan 07 2020
* Made attribute name in html brown instead of green to separate the colors better
* Made lists in markdown green instead of yellow
* Made table separators yellow instead of green
* Added color to string literals in JS

### Jan 02 2020

* Modified preview
* Started using changelog for updates

### Jan 01 2020
* Born!
