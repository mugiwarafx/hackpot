# Change Log

#### All notable changes to the "Hackpot" extension will be documented in this file.

### Jan 01 2020
* Born!

### Jan 02 2020
* Fixed credit link for icon
* Modified preview
* Started using changelog for updates

### Jan 07 2020
* Made attribute name in html brown instead of green to separate the colors better
* Made lists in markdown green instead of yellow
* Made table separators yellow instead of green
* Added color to string literals in JS

### Jan 09 2020
* Removed the color tan
  * Many said it looked too yellowish on their screens (my screen looked tan, but I saw what they saw)
  * Also Python variables wouldn't use the color on variables
  * Go would only use it when you initualize the variable
  * I tried to find another tan to replace it but they either didn't look tan or they conflicted with the brown or orange so I thought it'd be best to just remove it all together
  * Had some confusion with how they were colored
* Made meta objects light green instead of purple to prevent confusion with built in constants
